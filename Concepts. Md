🟦 1. Label Encoding

I. Converts categorical values into numeric labels (0, 1, 2, …).
II. Each category gets a unique integer.
III. Output is a single column with numeric values.
IV. Used for ordinal data (where order matters, e.g., Low < Medium < High).
V. May cause issues for nominal data because the model might assume an order.
VI. Example:
Color → Red = 0, Blue = 1, Green = 2
Education Level → Primary = 0, Secondary = 1, Graduate = 2


✅ Use Label Encoding when categories have order.

🟩 2. One Hot Encoding

I. Converts categorical values into binary vectors (0/1).
II. Each unique category becomes a separate column.
III. The category present is marked as 1, others as 0.
IV. Used for nominal data (where no order exists, e.g., color, gender).
V. Avoids false order but increases the number of columns (dimensionality).
VI. Example:
Color →
Red = [1, 0, 0]
Blue = [0, 1, 0]
Green = [0, 0, 1]
Gender → Male = [1, 0], Female = [0, 1]


✅ Use One Hot Encoding when categories have no order.
